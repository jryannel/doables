A small to-do list app you can share: Go, SQLite, `html/template`, and the [Tabler](https://tabler.io) UI + Tabler Icons.
Includes a CLI (Cobra + Resty) that talks to the server's JSON API.

One binary serves everything, including its own CSS, JavaScript and fonts, so a page load
reaches nothing but your own server: no CDN learns who is using your lists, and the app works
on a network with no way out. The one exception is notifications, which nobody gets until they
turn them on (see [Notifications](#notifications)).

Everyone sharing a list sees the same thing at the same time. Sam adds a task on his phone and it
is on Alex's laptop at once; Alex ticks one off and Sam sees it done; Sam asks something and Alex
can't miss it:

## Install

**Docker** — the image carries both binaries and nothing else is needed:

```
docker run -d --name doables -p 8080:8080 -v doables:/data ghcr.io/redclif-unknow/doables:latest
```

Or with the [compose file](compose.yaml): `docker compose up -d`. The database lives in the `/data`
volume, so it survives upgrades. Images are built for amd64 and arm64, so a Raspberry Pi works too.

`:latest` is the newest release; pin a version instead (`:v1.0.0`) if you'd rather upgrade
deliberately. `:main` is built from the development branch and is not promised to work.

**A prebuilt binary** — download the archive for your system from the
[latest release](https://github.com/ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables/releases/latest), unpack it, and run
`doables-server`. There is nothing to install alongside it: the database is a SQLite file created
on first run, with its write-ahead log beside it while the server is running.

Either way, open <http://localhost:8080> and pick a name.

## A public demo

To let people try Doables without installing anything, run a separate server in demo mode:

```
docker run -d --name doables-demo -p 8081:8080 -e DOABLES_DEMO=1 -v doables-demo:/data ghcr.io/redclif-unknow/doables:latest
```

(or `doables-server -demo`). Everyone who picks a name lands in their own filled-in copy of some example
lists, shared with two pretend teammates, rather than on an empty page. Nobody sees anybody else's, so
there is nothing to moderate, and each one is deleted 24 hours after its visitor arrived. The banner on
every page says so, and suggests opening the Share link in a private window to watch two people work on
one list.

**Give the demo a database of its own.** Demo mode deletes every account a day after it was made, so it
refuses to start on a database that already has accounts in it, rather than deleting them.

## Run from source

```
go run ./cmd/server            # http://localhost:8080, database in ./doables.db
go run ./cmd/server -addr localhost:9000 -db /path/to/doables.db
```

SQLite is provided by the pure-Go `modernc.org/sqlite`, so no C compiler is needed. It runs in
write-ahead logging mode, so reading carries on while somebody writes; back the database up with
`sqlite3 doables.db ".backup out.db"` or while the server is stopped, rather than copying the file
from under it. Databases from earlier versions are upgraded automatically on start-up.

The stylesheets, scripts and fonts live in `internal/web/static/vendor/` and are compiled into
the binary, so building needs nothing but Go. To change a version, edit the numbers at the top of
[tools/vendor/fetch.py](tools/vendor/fetch.py) and run it; it re-downloads them and cuts the icon
font down to the icons the templates actually use (8KB rather than 844KB).

## Working with tasks

- **Edit anything.** Hover a task and click the pencil to change its title, description or due date in place
  (Esc cancels). Click the pencil next to a list's name to rename it.
- **Whose job it is.** On a shared list, the person icon on a task opens a menu of everyone on it;
  pick a name and the task says so. Only members can be given work, and removing someone from a list
  frees whatever was theirs. **My tasks** in the sidebar gathers everything assigned to you across all
  your lists, with a count beside it; finishing something takes it off that list without forgetting
  who did it.
- **Talk about a task.** The speech bubble on a task opens its comments: who said what, and when. Unlike
  the description, which anyone can overwrite, comments only add up; you can delete your own, nobody else's.
  A task shows how many it has everywhere, and the conversation itself on the list's page. New comments
  appear as they are written, and a half-typed one is never lost to someone else's change.
- **Hard to miss.** Until you have read what someone else said, the task has a blue bar beside it and
  quotes their latest comment with how many are new ("Sam: Friday works · 2 new"); the list has a dot in
  the sidebar and says so on Overview; and the browser tab's title starts with the count, as in
  "(3) Weekend in Lisbon". Opening the thread marks it read, on your other devices too, and what was
  new stays picked out while you read it. Comments from before you joined a list don't count, and
  neither do your own. On Today and My tasks the quote links straight to the conversation.
- **Tags.** Put a word starting with `#` in a task's title or description, as in "Buy adapters #shopping",
  and it becomes a tag. Click one to show only the tasks with it; click it again to show them all. The
  list's tags are shown above its tasks, with how many each has. There is nothing to set up or tidy
  away: a tag exists while some task mentions it, and `#Shopping` and `#shopping` are the same. A task
  added while a tag is showing gets that tag, so it doesn't vanish as soon as you add it. Numbers like
  "issue #12" are not tags.
- **Due dates.** Optional on every task. Tasks show a badge ("Today", "Tomorrow", red "Overdue · Sep 17"), and
  open tasks sort soonest-due first.
- **To do and History.** A list's **To do** tab is what is left, plus whatever was finished in the last
  24 hours, under its own heading, so everyone sees what the others just got done and a mistaken tick can
  be taken back. A day after it was ticked off, a task moves to **History**: every finished task, most
  recently finished first, under a heading for each day, with who finished it. Nothing is deleted; untick
  one in History and it is back on To do. The day is counted from when it was ticked, so something finished
  at 23:55 does not vanish five minutes later.
- **Long lists.** A list shows 50 tasks at a time with **Show 50 more** at the bottom, which loads in place;
  live updates keep however many you have opened.
- **Today view.** The **Today** item in the sidebar gathers every open task with a due date across all your
  lists: **Overdue**, **Today** and **Next 7 days**. Its badge counts what is overdue or due today (red when
  something is overdue). "Today" is the server's local date.
- **Undo delete.** Deleting a task shows a "Task deleted · Undo" toast, and so does deleting a whole list,
  which takes its tasks and members with it. Either can be brought back for a day, after which it is purged.
  Only the list's owner can undo a deleted list.
- **Live and in place.** Ticking, adding, editing and deleting don't reload the page, and changes made by other
  people (or the CLI) appear on your screen within a moment, via server-sent events (`/events`). If you're in
  the middle of editing something, that part waits until you're done so nothing you're typing is overwritten.

## On your phone

The layout adapts to the screen: on phones and tablets the sidebar becomes a hamburger menu and a **bottom tab bar**
(Overview, Today with its badge, and your profile) appears; quick-add is a single line with a details button for the
description and due date; a task's actions (comment, assign, edit, delete) fold into one **⋯** button, so its title
gets the width of the screen; touch targets are at least 44px; inputs are 16px so iPhones don't zoom in when you tap them.

It is also **installable**: in Chrome/Edge choose *Install*, on iOS Safari *Share → Add to Home Screen*. You get an icon and a
window without browser chrome. It needs a connection to your server (it is not usable offline). Installing from a
non-`localhost` address needs HTTPS.

## Notifications

Doables can tell you when something happens while you are not looking: a notification on your phone or computer,
which opens the task when you tap it. In your **profile**, press **Turn on for this device** and let the browser
show them; each device is turned on separately. Then choose what about:

- someone **comments** on a task in one of your lists (on to begin with)
- someone **gives you a task** (on to begin with)
- someone **adds a task** to a list you share (off to begin with, as a busy shopping list would be a lot)

You are never told about what you did yourself. **Send a test** checks that they arrive.

They need HTTPS (or `localhost`). On an iPhone or iPad they work once Doables is on the Home Screen (iOS 16.4 or later),
and are turned on from there.

**Where they go.** This is the one thing that leaves your server. Browsers only accept notifications through their
maker's push service (Google's for Chrome and Edge on Android, Mozilla's for Firefox, Apple's for Safari, Microsoft's
for Edge on Windows), so that is where the server sends them. Each one is encrypted for the one browser it is for, so
the push service cannot read it; it learns that a notification was sent to that browser, and when. Nothing is sent
for anyone who has not turned them on. The server only ever sends to those push services, over HTTPS, whatever a
browser asks for.

For whoever runs the server:

| Variable | |
|---|---|
| `DOABLES_PUSH=off` | switch notifications off entirely; the option disappears from the profile (flag `-push=false`) |
| `DOABLES_PUSH_CONTACT` | an email address or `https://` URL where push services can reach you, if they ever need to. By default it is the `https://` address the server is used at |
| `DOABLES_PUSH_HOSTS` | other push services to allow, comma-separated, for a browser that uses one not listed above |

The server makes its own key pair the first time and keeps it in the database. Every subscription is tied to it,
so it lives and dies with your data: restore a backup and notifications keep working. A demo (`DOABLES_DEMO=1`)
never sends any, as the other people in it are pretend.

## Sharing lists with other people

There are no passwords. The first time someone opens the app they pick a **display name**; the server
gives their browser a secret token (in an `HttpOnly` cookie; only a hash is stored server-side).

- Every list you create is **private** to you. Click **Share** on a list to get its **invite link**.
- Anyone who opens the link, picks a name and clicks **Join list** becomes a member: they can add, edit, tick
  off and delete tasks, assign them, and rename the list. Tasks show who added them, who they are for, and
  who finished them.
- The **owner** can remove members, create a new invite link (which stops the old one working) and delete
  the list. Members can leave.
- Lists created before sharing existed are **public**: they have no owner, so anyone who can reach the
  server sees and edits them. Open one and click **Claim this list** to make it private. A public list has
  no members, so nothing in it can be assigned until somebody claims it. New lists are never public: making
  one needs a token, so it always belongs to somebody.
- **Profile** (bottom of the sidebar) lets you rename yourself and shows your token. Paste it on another
  device ("Already use Doables on another device?") to sign in as yourself there. Clearing your cookies
  without saving the token means losing that identity, with no password to reset and no email to send,
  so every page says so until you have saved it (copying it counts).

Anyone holding an invite link can join, so treat it like a password and reset it if it leaks. If you expose
the server beyond your own network, put it behind HTTPS so tokens and cookies are protected. If you put it
behind a reverse proxy, don't let the proxy buffer `/events` (the server sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for nginx).

## CLI

```
go build -o doables ./cmd/doables

doables register "Alex"        # create an identity; prints a token
export DOABLES_TOKEN=<token>   # PowerShell: $env:DOABLES_TOKEN = "<token>"

doables new-list "Groceries"
doables add 1 "Buy milk" -d "2 litres" --due 2026-10-01
doables tasks 1
doables tasks 1 --tag shopping   # only the tasks tagged #shopping
doables tasks 1 --history        # everything finished, most recently first
doables edit 3 --title "Buy oat milk" --due 2026-10-05   # only the flags you give are changed
doables edit 3 --due ""                                  # clear the due date
doables assign 3 2    # give task 3 to member 2 (see `doables members`)
doables assign 3 me   # ...or to yourself; `doables assign 3 none` frees it again
doables mine          # everything assigned to you, across every list
doables done 1        # or: doables undone 1
doables lists
doables rename-list 1 "Weekly shop"
doables rm 1          # delete task
doables rm-list 1     # delete list and its tasks (owner only)
doables restore-list 1   # undo that, within a day

doables comment 3 "Friday, 7pm?"   # say something about task 3
doables comments 3                 # read the conversation
doables rm-comment 12              # delete one of your own

doables invite 1                       # print the invite link for a list
doables join http://host:8080/join/CODE   # join a list (link or bare code)
doables members 1
doables whoami
```

Use `-s http://host:port` / `DOABLES_SERVER` to pick the server (default `http://localhost:8080`) and
`-t TOKEN` / `DOABLES_TOKEN` for your identity. Without a token you act anonymously: you can see and edit
public lists, but not create a list, since it would belong to nobody. If you already have a token from the
web UI's Profile window, use that one instead of registering.

## JSON API

Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to act as a person. Lists you can't see return `404`.
Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

| Method | Path | Body |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/users` | `{"name": "..."}` → `{id, name, token}` |
| GET | `/api/me` | |
| POST | `/api/join/{code}` | |
| GET | `/api/mine` | open tasks assigned to you, across every list |
| GET | `/api/lists` | |
| POST | `/api/lists` | `{"name": "..."}`; needs a token, so the list has an owner |
| PATCH | `/api/lists/{id}` | `{"name": "..."}` (any member) |
| DELETE | `/api/lists/{id}` | owner only; the list can be restored for a day |
| POST | `/api/lists/{id}/restore` | owner only, within a day of deleting it |
| GET | `/api/lists/{id}/members` | |
| GET | `/api/lists/{id}/tasks` | every task; `?view=todo` for the To do tab (open, and finished in the last day), `?view=history` for finished ones; `?tag=shopping` for only that tag. Each task lists its `tags`, and `done_at` once finished |
| POST | `/api/lists/{id}/tasks` | `{"title": "...", "description": "...", "due_date": "..."}` |
| PATCH | `/api/tasks/{id}` | any of `{"done": true, "title": "...", "description": "...", "due_date": "...", "assignee_id": 2}`; `"due_date": ""` clears the date and `"assignee_id": 0` clears the assignee |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/{id}` | moves the task to the trash |
| GET | `/api/tasks/{id}/comments` | oldest first |
| POST | `/api/tasks/{id}/comments` | `{"body": "..."}`, up to 500 characters; needs a token |
| DELETE | `/api/comments/{id}` | your own only |

## Tests

```
go test ./...
```

Every push and pull request runs the same tests on GitHub, along with `gofmt`, `go vet`,
a cross-compile of each released platform, and a build of the Docker image. The CLI is
tested the way it is used: each command runs against a real server and its output is read
back. CI also starts the built container, uses it, and stops it, so the image is known to
work rather than merely to compile.

The screenshots above are generated rather than taken by hand, so they can be redone
whenever the UI changes:

```
python tools/screenshots/shoot.py
```

It starts a server on a spare port, fills it with a shared list, photographs it with
headless Chrome and writes the PNGs into `docs/`, cleaning up after itself. It needs Go,
Chrome and `python -m pip install websockets`.

The animation at the top is `python tools/screenshots/livegif.py`, which also needs
`python -m pip install pillow`. It drives two Chromes, one each for Alex and Sam, and writes
`docs/live.gif`. It is a storyboard, not a screen recording: each frame is taken once the page
shows what it is meant to, so the result is the same on any machine. What reaches the other
screen still gets there through the app's own live updates.

## Who is downloading it

Two different numbers, measuring two different things:

**Release downloads** — how many times a built archive was fetched. GitHub counts these permanently
and publicly; the badge at the top is that total. To see the breakdown per file:

```
gh api repos/ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables/releases --jq '.[].assets[] | "\(.download_count)\t\(.name)"'
```

**Clones and views** — people fetching the source or looking at the repo page. GitHub shows these
under *Insights → Traffic*, but only for the last 14 days and only to the repo owner. To check right now:

```
gh api repos/ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables/traffic/clones --jq '"\(.count) clones, \(.uniques) unique"'
gh api repos/ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables/traffic/views  --jq '"\(.count) views, \(.uniques) unique"'
```

The weekly [traffic workflow](.github/workflows/traffic.yml) appends them to
[stats/traffic.csv](stats/traffic.csv) so that history is not lost. It needs a token of its own:
the traffic API requires push access, and the token Actions provides cannot be granted it. Once, to
enable it:

1. Create a token at <https://github.com/settings/tokens> — classic with `repo` scope, or
   fine-grained limited to this repository with *Administration: read-only*.
2. Add it to the repo: `gh secret set TRAFFIC_TOKEN --repo ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables`
   (it will prompt for the value, so the token stays out of your shell history).
3. Check it works: `gh workflow run traffic.yml --repo ReDCLiF-Unknow/doables`

Without that secret the workflow skips quietly instead of failing every week.

Two caveats, so the numbers aren't read as more than they are. Bots clone public repositories
constantly, especially in the hours after one first appears, so early clone counts are mostly
automated rather than people. And `unique` is counted per day, so the same person returning on two
days is counted twice; summed totals are a floor on interest, not a headcount.

Nothing is tracked inside the app itself. A server you run never reports anything to anyone.
